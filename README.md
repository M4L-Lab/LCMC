## Introduction

Welcome to LCMC (Long Chain Monte Carlo), an innovative open-source package designed for finding alloy ground states using an enhanced Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Unlike traditional Monte Carlo simulations where each step is random, our implementation leverages the number of previous Monte Carlo steps to make more informed predictions, leading to significantly faster discovery of alloy ground states.

LCMC is a valuable tool for researchers and scientists in materials science and computational chemistry, providing an efficient and accurate way to explore and identify alloy configurations with minimal computational effort.

## Features

- Utilizes an enhanced Monte-Carlo simulation method to find alloy ground states.
- Incorporates previous Monte Carlo steps to make informed predictions for faster convergence.
- Benchmarked for improved efficiency compared to traditional Monte Carlo simulations.
- User-friendly interface and customizable parameters for tailored simulations.
- Open-source and well-documented for transparency and collaborative development.
